# Development of Movement

On Sensory Perception:  
“The child is an observer who through his senses is actively absorbing images, and this is very different from saying that he is able to receive them like a mirror” (Secret of Childhood, p60) implies that the child needs activity. No one can develop without experience, they need opportunity to be active and experience things, ***they are sensory-motor explorers***.

+ Child is not born with coordinated movement, it is acquired over time (unlike with animals where they are born pretty much able to move/walk)
+ Needs other human beings to learn from
+ We all move, we all walk, we all use our hands but no two human beings move in exactly the same way - it’s not _possible_

### Key Milestones 0-3 in Movement
That the child goes through in the _period of 0-3_ in acquiring upright posture
+ Sitting (around 6 m)
+ Crawling (around 8m)
+ Standing (around 10m)
+ Walking (around 12m)
  


## Coordinated Movement
+ **Sensitive Period** for movement, 1.5 years - 4 years

+ Achieving the unity between the mind and the body needed for coordinated movement is a process
+ Depends on the maturation of the nervous system
+ It is only through their only _self propelled_ movement that babies develop coordinated movement
+ Don’t use containers, use low mirrors and objects to encourage movement, use light weight clothing


### In the children's house:  
+ Think about all the movements involved in showing a child how to pour water from a jug for the first time
+ The more we show something with precision, the clearer it is for the child, they have a human tendency to exactness
  + We don’t want to mute ourselves fully, but we need to show with actions and not with words (think about learning to pour water from a jug)
  + Remember they can’t focus on what you’re saying AND what you’re demonstrating at the same time
+ Imitation (human tendency) gives us an idea of HOW to do something but is not blind parroting
+ In a Montessori environment, teaching is not telling/speaking
  + _Everything_ involves ***movement***
