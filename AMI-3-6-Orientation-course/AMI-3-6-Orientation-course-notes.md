# Development of Movement

On Sensory Perception:  
“The child is an observer who through his senses is actively absorbing images, and this is very different from saying that he is able to receive them like a mirror” (Secret of Childhood, p60) implies that the child needs activity. No one can develop without experience, they need opportunity to be active and experience things, ***they are sensory-motor explorers***.

+ Child is not born with coordinated movement, it is acquired over time (unlike with animals where they are born pretty much able to move/walk)
+ Needs other human beings to learn from
+ We all move, we all walk, we all use our hands but no two human beings move in exactly the same way - it’s not _possible_

### Key Milestones 0-3 in Movement
That the child goes through in the _period of 0-3_ in acquiring upright posture
+ Sitting (around 6 m)
+ Crawling (around 8m)
+ Standing (around 10m)
+ Walking (around 12m)
  


## Coordinated Movement
+ **Sensitive Period** for movement, 1.5 years - 4 years

+ Achieving the unity between the mind and the body needed for coordinated movement is a process
+ Depends on the maturation of the nervous system
+ It is only through their only _self propelled_ movement that babies develop coordinated movement
+ Don’t use containers, use low mirrors and objects to encourage movement, use light weight clothing


### In the children's house:  
+ Think about all the movements involved in showing a child how to pour water from a jug for the first time
+ The more we show something with precision, the clearer it is for the child, they have a human tendency to exactness
  + We don’t want to mute ourselves fully, but we need to show with actions and not with words (think about learning to pour water from a jug)
  + Remember they can’t focus on what you’re saying AND what you’re demonstrating at the same time
+ Imitation (human tendency) gives us an idea of HOW to do something but is not blind parroting
+ In a Montessori environment, teaching is not telling/speaking
  + _Everything_ involves ***movement***


# Development of Language
+ Through the human tendency of Communication and the **Absorbent Mind**, a child learns the language of their environment easily, effortlessly and by virtue of their experiences
+ There is no need for something like baby talk because the AM doesn't know easy vs difficult language, so there is no need to downgrade our language for the child
+ There is also the **Sensitive Period** for language (from birth to 6 years), drawing the child's attention/focus to the voice and this human characteristic of language
+ Remember that long before the child can speak, they are taking in everything in 
+ At around **2 months** the child has gained control of the neck and _begins to turn towards the human voice_ which MM called 'delicious music' to the child
+ Around **4 months** they begin to look at the speaker's mouth intently and try to imitate the movements
+ Around **6 months** they begin to babble
+ Telegraphic speech (2 words together are next)
  + Fusive speech where they combine syllable of 2 words "mupper" instead of saying "me, supper"

## Sound Game

**Aim:** is for the child to become _aware_ of the sounds in their language and help them to **analyse the sounds in the words**.

+ This is a SOUND game, not a letter game, so phonograms like `sh` and `ch` and the `dj` sound in `giraffe` are all part of this game 
+ Start playing it immediately as the children come into the Children's House, so from 2.5 onwards.
+ The adult's skill is to organise the groups of kids in such a way that the skill level is the same so that a child who is far ahead doesn't get bored
  + You might say "This one is for Meghan, ..." if you have a child of a different level in the group to keep them interested
+ Indirect preparation for the sandpaper letters and the movable alphabet
+ Many other things grow from this sound game, such as expansion of the child's vocabulary

### Stage 1: Exploring the first sound
#### Stage 1A
+ 6 to 7 objects
+ Hold up an object
+ "I spy with my little eye, something _that I am holding_ that begins with 'b'" (use phonetic sound)
+ Children answer collectively

#### Stage 1B
+ Now 6/7 objects _on a mat_
+ I spy with my little eye, something _on the mat_ beginning with 'l'" (again, phonetic sound)
+ Could just use 2 objects and go up from there if the child needs this
+ You should _start_ with **contrasting sounds**
+ The _progression_ here is to use similar sounds like `b` and `v` or `p`, `m` and `n` for example

#### Stage 1C
+ Choose an area of the environment and be sure that there are _multiple_ things in that area that begin with the same sound
+ I spy with my little eye, something beginning with `b`
  + `bottle`
  + "Yes, can you see anything else?"
  + `basket`, etc
+ The point of this progression is that children understand that there are many things around us that begins with the same sound

### Stage 2: Exploring the first _and_ last sound

#### Stage 2A
+ Still on the mat, start with one pair of items, both with the same beginning sound
+ "I spy with my little eye something that begins with `b` and ends with `a`"
  + `Banana`
+ The idea here is to have multiple pairs of objects with the **same beginning sound** but ***different end sound**
  + Always use _pairs_
+ Examples: `peg` and `plate`, `brush` and `bowl`, `flag` and `fork`, `book` and `bowl`
+ Start with 1 pair and then judging by the child's comfort levels, start to add more pairs

#### Stage 2B
+ Expand into the whole environment, not just pairs
+ Still say the beginning and end sound
+ Also fun out and about, at shops, markets, etc

### Stage 3: Listening to all the sounds in a chosen word (no objects necessary)
+ No objects necessary, just choose a word, like `apple`
+ Typically we use nouns to keep with the pattern from the first stages
+ "What sounds do we hear in `apple`? What's the first sound?" "What's next?" etc
+ Be _very careful_, you're using the **sounds**, `l` not `luh`
  + It has _nothing to do with the spelling_
+ `table` has `t`, **`ai`** (not `a` or `ay`, check the phonetic sheet for the spelling of the sound but you don't actually ever need to spell it), `b`, `l`  
+ `orange` would be `o`, `r`, `i`, `n`,`j`

### Stage 4:
+ Don't give a word but a sound and invite the children to come up with words 
+ "Please think of a word that have `o` in it? You know what? The sound can be at the beginning, anywhere in the middle or even at the end!"

## Classified Cards

**Aim:** Enriching the child's **vocabulary** and helps the child to **classify their environment**.
  

10-15 cards in a set, given to _individual_ children, not a group like the sound game was.
  
Note that these sets need to reflect the child's environment. A kitchen will look different in different in different countries.

1. Introduce the material to the child 
2. Invite the child to spread a floor mat
3. Invite the child to carry the material to the floor mat
4. "Today we chose to work with the kitchen cards (see below for the progression of the card subjects)"
5. Take the picture of the whole (in this case the whole kitchen) "Let's look at this picture here, what do you recognise?" "A clock, ah, do you have a clock on your kitchen wall?" "What else do you see?"
6. Place the piture of the whole in the top centre
7. Start taking cards from the pile and placing them in a line below the picture of the kitchen (on the next row), one by one and **asking them what each item is**
    + If the child knows the name, leave the card on the mat
    + If the child _doesn't_ know the name, name the image and either make a mental note or **turn the card over and put it in a separate pile**
    + Occasionally add in some commentary about the items "yes, it's a pan, we could even call it a frying pan", "Yes, do you have one of these at home?"
8. When you're done, invite the child to put most of the cards away and **leave 3 cards out** and then you would give a _3 period lesson_ (see below)
    + 3 cards
    + Contrasting in appearance and name

You would include this progression of the cards:
+ Start with the `home` environment, things like kitchen, bedroom, etc
+ Move to `neighbourhood` environment, things like train station, market, florist, park (specific to each child of course)
+ Move to `cultural` area, including geography, botany, arts, science and music
