## On Maria Montessori
+ One of the first female doctors in Italy
+ Very pro-women’s rights
+ Had a child out of wedlock in 1898
  + She sent him to live with a family in the countryside as she didn’t want to marry and give up her career
  + Originally visited him as an aunt and then he found out she was his mother
  + Began living with her in 1912/13
  + Became her biggest supporter
+ Casa dei Bambini opened 6th January 1907 in San Lorenzo slum in Rome
+ In 1916 she moves to Barcelona  
+ Passed away in 1952 as she was planning to take the pedagogy to Africa


## Human Tendencies
+ Unlike the Absorbent Mind and the Sensitive Periods, they last throughout our lives and support our development throughout our lives
+ Tendency implies a propensity to behave or think in a particular way
+ They are common to all of us and support our development but also the development and progression of the community (universal)
+ It is a bent, inclination, proneness, disposition, leaning
+ A tendency implies a predisposition to think, act, behave, or proceed in a particular way
+ ‘Aptness to move in a particular direction ro way… impelling force that will operate if not a counteracted’ (Shorter Oxford Dictionary)

### The Purpose of the Human Tendencies
+ Tendencies are essential for human beings to survive and develop fully
+ These inborn directives, which lead the human being to act in a certain way, are common to all humanity and work for common and individual progress
+ They help the human being to adapt to their environment. The conditions of any environment change with time but certain tendencies within the human being will never change, hence the human being is provided with the capability of adaptation


### Features of the Human Tendencies
+ Universal
+ Deeply inter-related and support the work of one another
+ They last throughout our lives but how they are revealed will depend on the plane of development one is at and must be responded to and fulfilled accordingly
+ They must have an appropriate environment

### List of Human Tendencies
Not carved in stone or absolute but here are the main ones:
+ Movement
+ Orientation
+ Exploration
+ Gregariousness
+ Communication
+ Order
+ Curiosity
+ Calculation
+ Repetition
+ Perfection
+ Creative Imagination
+ Imitation
+ Self control
+ Exactness/precision
+ Work/activity
+ Independence
+ Concentration
+ Abstraction

## Planes of Development


1. Infancy (0-6 years)
2. Childhood (6-12 years)
3. Adolescence (12-18 years)
4. Maturity (18-24 years)

During each plane, the child has very distinct characteristics and needs.

![The Four Planes of Development](https://github.com/nelsonic/shoshin/assets/4185328/8a8b9829-5e63-4c2a-9339-948157c4853b)
  

+ The red signifies enormous transformation and change
+ Dotted line after 24 signifies that we are constantly learning and developing, despite the major construction of the human being having been complete by this time

Needs across the 4 planes:
+ Physical
+ Cognitive (intellectual)
+ Emotional
+ Social

Think of the metamorphosis of the butterfly: each phase is independent but they are incredibly interconnected. It is very important to appreciate the _unity_ of the 4 planes, just as the phases of the butterfly’s development.



## The First Plane
The task of the child under 6 is ***adaptation and self-construction***.  
  

“Help me to do it by myself.”


### The Second Plane
+ Has a _reasoning_ mind, not an absorbent mind
+ Asks why and how?
+ Now start questioning everything
+ Are very interested in questions of a moral nature - right/wrong, acceptable/not acceptable
+ The peer group is very important to them
+ We need to be a sounding board and support the child
+ MM called this the “Age of Rudeness” because children can be very blunt but also the “Age of Serenity” because there are no drastic changes

“We might say that the younger children take things in sensorially. The child of seven enters the abstract field, he wishes to know the reasons.” - Maria Montessori, Citizen of the World, p.32  
  
“Help me to _think_ by myself.”

## The Third Plane
+ Enormous transformation and change - at the beginning of the 3rd plane we see a child and at the end we see a young adult
+ Preparation for adulthood
+ Find their calling and mission in this plane
+ MM wrote the blueprint for the adolescent plane but these were put into practice after she passed away
+ VERY important that the adolescent feels valued, they need to feel they are making a contribution
+ They are preparing for adult life, gaining independence in many ways (including financial independence)

## The Fourth Plane
+ Putting their mission into practice
+ Individual is largely formed at this point
+ Harvesting of what has gone before


# The Absorbent Mind

```
“… children possess a mental structure quite unlike that of adults, and a totally different psychic field, endowed with far greater power and sensibility; faculties that allow them to be unconscious creators. I have named this mental structure the absorbent mind. 
However, the mind of the child does not absorb like a sponge letting water through without retaining it; the mind of the child absorbs enduringly, thereby creating the character of the adult to become.’  
- Maria Montessori, Citizen of the World, p 95, Montessori-Pierson
```

+ Absorption is not something that the child chooses to do consciously
+ Child’s mind is not conscious, without judgement and non selective, it’s not conscious
+ Sponge analogy is really not great because when you pick up a sponge filled with water, it leaks but a child’s mind does not
+ Camera and painter analogies are more apt
+ “Unconscious creator” at 0-3
  + Child is making all these acquisitions but is not conscious of the absorption taking place
+ During 3-6
  + Absorption is enhanced through child’s own activity
+ Easy, effortless and permanent acquisition
+ Value acquisition also happens in this time
+ A child absorbs everything, even those that are not concrete: safety, security, love

Other points to note:
+ Greetings are where cultural traits and movement most obviously overlap
+ Food is also a cultural trait


# Sensitive Periods
+ Supposedly Hugo de Vries gave the term but now it is actually thought that it might have been from Jacques Loeb who studied the Porthesia Butterfly (de Vries actually studied flora and not the butterfly)
+ She got the term from the scientists who studied that the Porthesia butterfly caterpillar is drawn to the tips of the tender leaves by the light
+ Draw the child’s attention to those aspects of the environment that help the child to create human characteristics _or_ functions
  + Characteristics are what makes us human
  + Function implies the use of the characteristics
+ Sensitive periods are extremely selective (unlike the absorbent mind which takes in _everything_ easily) because they really draw the child’s attention to specific things
+ They have a gradual, often subtle beginning, followed by a point of intensity and then gradually fade
+ If we cater for these innate sensitivities we notice the child often expresses joy and contentment
+ ***These SPs are NOT for learning***, their purpose is much deeper, it’s to help acquire characteristics

![Sensitive Periods](https://github.com/nelsonic/shoshin/assets/4185328/38e4bd61-b1ef-4902-abb0-6225a1e6c134)

  
### Sensitive Period for Language
+ One of the longest SPs
+ Long before the child is able to express themselves, they turn to the human voice and react to it (they express joy)
+ Rich oral language scheme but also introduces children to writing and reading in the Children’s House
  + Learned with more joy and sense of discovery in a way that responds to the child’s developmental needs
+ Gives focus to the human voice, complementing the Absorbent Mind perfectly

### Order 1-3 years
+ Fundamentally we are talking about order of the mind
+ Order helps children feel safe and secure and builds trust in the environment
+ It’s not superficial, it goes very very deep
+ MM said it’s one of the most important and mysterious
+ “love for order”

## Sensitive Period for Small Objects, 1-2 years
+ Can think of this as a sensitive period for detail
+ Their interest is captured by the tiniest thing whereas you and I might be indifferent to it
  + Like they notice the flea on the cat much more than the cat
+ Give them _time_ to explore the detail
+ Matched excitement when they find the tiny details 


## Sensitive Period for Refinement of Sensory Perception, 0 to almost 5 years old
+ Senses are a bridge between ourselves and our external environment
+ Better able to differentiate and distinguish things
+ The sharper our senses are, the closer our connection and the more accurate the feedback we receive from our surroundings is


## Sensitive Period for Coordinated Movement, 1.5-4 years old
+ The child is not born with coordinated movement, it is developed with enormous effort and activity
+ Coordination is between the mind and the body
+ The child often has an _internal_ purpose and this is when we see them repeat the same thing over and over again
  + When we allow the repetition to be satisfied it often leads to concentration
  + e.g. When a child puts on their shoe but then takes it off again and puts it on and takes it off and so on

## Sensitive Period for Social Behaviour, 2.5 - 6 years old
+ Family is the first social group usually
+ Child really sees a wider social exposure/group and eager to be with other children and adults
+ One response in the Children’s House to this is the mixed age group, allowing the children to live a truly social life with other children
+ Through grace and courtesy activities as well

They are innate and the environment can support or hinder.

# Development of Movement

On Sensory Perception:  
“The child is an observer who through his senses is actively absorbing images, 
and this is very different from saying that he is able 
to receive them like a mirror” (Secret of Childhood, p60) implies 
that the child needs activity. 
No one can develop without experience, 
they need opportunity to be active and experience things, 
***they are sensory-motor explorers***.

+ Child is not born with coordinated movement,
  it is acquired over time
  (unlike with animals where they are born pretty much able to move/walk)
+ Needs other human beings to learn from
+ We all move, we all walk, we all use our hands
  but no two human beings move in exactly the same way - it’s not _possible_

### Key Milestones 0-3 in Movement

That the child goes through in the _period of 0-3_ in acquiring upright posture
+ Sitting (around 6 m)
+ Crawling (around 8m)
+ Standing (around 10m)
+ Walking (around 12m)
  


## Coordinated Movement

+ **Sensitive Period** for movement, 1.5 years - 4 years

+ Achieving the unity between the mind and the body needed for coordinated movement is a process
+ Depends on the maturation of the nervous system
+ It is only through their only _self propelled_ movement that babies develop coordinated movement
+ Don’t use containers, use low mirrors and objects to encourage movement, use light weight clothing


### In the children's house:  

+ Think about all the movements involved in showing a child
  how to pour water from a jug for the first time
+ The more we show something with precision,
  the clearer it is for the child, they have a human tendency to exactness
  + We don’t want to mute ourselves fully,
    but we need to show with actions and not with words
    (think about learning to pour water from a jug)
  + Remember they can’t focus on what you’re saying
    AND what you’re demonstrating at the same time
+ Imitation (human tendency) gives us an idea
  of HOW to do something but is not blind parroting
+ In a Montessori environment, teaching is not telling/speaking
  + _Everything_ involves ***movement***


# Development of Language

+ Through the human tendency of Communication and the **Absorbent Mind**,
  a child learns the language of their environment easily,
  effortlessly and by virtue of their experiences
+ There is no need for something like baby talk
  because the AM doesn't know easy vs difficult language,
  so there is no need to downgrade our language for the child
+ There is also the **Sensitive Period** for language (from birth to 6 years),
  drawing the child's attention/focus to the voice and this human characteristic of language
+ Remember that long before the child can speak, they are taking in everything in 
+ At around **2 months** the child has gained control of the neck
  and _begins to turn towards the human voice_ which MM called 'delicious music' to the child
+ Around **4 months** they begin to look at the speaker's mouth intently
  and try to imitate the movements
+ Around **6 months** they begin to babble
+ Telegraphic speech (2 words together are next)
  + Fusive speech where they combine syllable of 2 words
    "mupper" instead of saying "me, supper"
See 0-3 course notes for a bit more detail on this but ...

> **TODO**: complete this last sentence and deep link to 0-3 notes. 



## Sound Game

**Aim:** is for the child to become _aware_ of the sounds in their language 
and help them to **analyse the sounds in the words**.

+ This is a SOUND game, not a letter game,
  so phonograms like `sh` and `ch` and the `dj` sound in `giraffe`
  are all part of this game 
+ Start playing it immediately as the children come into the Children's House, so from 2.5 onwards.
+ The adult's skill is to organise the groups of kids
  in such a way that the skill level is the same
  so that a child who is far ahead doesn't get bored
  + You might say "This one is for Meghan, ..."
    if you have a child of a different level in the group to keep them interested
+ Indirect preparation for the sandpaper letters and the movable alphabet
+ Many other things grow from this sound game, such as expansion of the child's vocabulary

### Stage 1: Exploring the first sound

#### Stage 1A

+ 6 to 7 objects
+ Hold up an object
+ "I spy with my little eye,
  something _that I am holding_ that begins with 'b'" (use phonetic sound)
+ Children answer collectively

#### Stage 1B

+ Now 6/7 objects _on a mat_
+ I spy with my little eye, something _on the mat_ beginning with 'l'" (again, phonetic sound)
+ Could just use 2 objects and go up from there if the child needs this
+ You should _start_ with **contrasting sounds**
+ The _progression_ here is to use similar sounds
  like `b` and `v` or `p`, `m` and `n` for example

#### Stage 1C

+ Choose an area of the environment and be sure
  that there are _multiple_ things in that area that begin with the same sound
+ I spy with my little eye, something beginning with `b`
  + `bottle`
  + "Yes, can you see anything else?"
  + `basket`, etc
+ The point of this progression is that children understand
  that there are many things around us that begins with the same sound

### Stage 2: Exploring the first _and_ last sound

#### Stage 2A

+ Still on the mat, start with one pair of items, both with the same beginning sound
+ "I spy with my little eye something that begins with `b` and ends with `a`"
  + `Banana`
+ The idea here is to have multiple pairs of objects
  with the **same beginning sound** but ***different end sound**
  + Always use _pairs_
  + Examples: `peg` and `plate`, `brush` and `bowl`, `flag` and `fork`, `book` and `bowl`
+ Start with 1 pair and then judging by the child's comfort levels, start to add more pairs

#### Stage 2B

+ Expand into the whole environment, not just pairs
+ Still say the beginning and end sound
+ Also fun out and about, at shops, markets, etc

### Stage 3: Listening to all the sounds in a chosen word (no objects necessary)

+ No objects necessary, just choose a word, like `apple`
+ Typically we use nouns to keep with the pattern from the first stages
+ "What sounds do we hear in `apple`? What's the first sound?" "What's next?" etc
+ Be _very careful_, you're using the **sounds**, `l` not `luh`
  + It has _nothing to do with the spelling_
+ `table` has `t`, **`ai`** (not `a` or `ay`,
  check the phonetic sheet for the spelling of the sound
  but you don't actually ever need to spell it), `b`, `l`  
+ `orange` would be `o`, `r`, `i`, `n`,`j`

### Stage 4:

+ Don't give a word but a sound and invite the children to come up with words 
+ "Please think of a word that have `o` in it? You know what?
  The sound can be at the beginning, anywhere in the middle or even at the end!"

## Classified Cards

**Aim:** Enriching the child's **vocabulary** 
and helps the child to **classify their environment**.
  

10-15 cards in a set, given to _individual_ children, 
not a group like the sound game was.
  
Note that these sets need to reflect the child's environment. 
A kitchen will look different in different in different countries.

1. Introduce the material to the child 
2. Invite the child to spread a floor mat
3. Invite the child to carry the material to the floor mat
4. "Today we chose to work with the kitchen cards (see below for the progression of the card subjects)"
5. Take the picture of the whole (in this case the whole kitchen)
   "Let's look at this picture here, what do you recognise?"
   "A clock, ah, do you have a clock on your kitchen wall?" "What else do you see?"
6. Place the piture of the whole in the top centre
7. Start taking cards from the pile and placing them in a line
   below the picture of the kitchen (on the next row), one by one and **asking them what each item is**
    + If the child knows the name, leave the card on the mat
    + If the child _doesn't_ know the name, name the image and either make a mental note
      or **turn the card over and put it in a separate pile**
    + Occasionally add in some commentary about the items "yes, it's a pan,
      we could even call it a frying pan", "Yes, do you have one of these at home?"
8. When you're done, invite the child to put most of the cards away
   and **leave 3 cards out** and then you would give a _3 period lesson_ (see below)
    + 3 cards
    + Contrasting in appearance and name

You would include this progression of the cards:
+ Start with the `home` environment, things like kitchen, bedroom, etc
+ Move to `neighbourhood` environment,
  things like train station, market, florist, park
  (specific to each child of course)
+ Move to `cultural` area, including geography, botany, arts, science and music

## Songs and Poetry

+ Ways through which we can continue to expand and enrich the child's vocabulary
+ Very important part of our interaction with children and one of the ways we communicate
+ Can be a very nice bonding moment between children
  and also children and adults in the Children's House
+ Songs that are already familiar to the child
  can be a very good bridge between their home life and the Children's House
+ Should be interwoven into the daily life at the children's house
  + Should have songs and poems for every ocassion and just for fun!
+ May also help children who are shy to come out of their shell a little
+ Have to be careful we choose something appropriate for the children and their culture
+ _Avoid anything that is violent_ or disrespectful
  + `3 Blind Mice` is a good example of this, terrible lyrics!
  + `Atirei o Pau ao Gato` in Portuguese!
  + Animals eating other animals for example, like the monkeys SNAP being eaten by an alligator

**5 categories of Poetry to discuss today:**

1. Poems and Rhymes
2. Finger Plays
3. Songs
4. Action Songs 
5. Singing Games

### Poems & Rhymes

+ A _poem_ is often a little more complex or subtle in meaning than a _rhyme_
  + Poems may also have a slightly more complicated structure
+ Nursery rhymes are an example of rhymes

#### **Example of a poem**

The Ladybird,  
by Spike Milligan

How brave a ladybird must be  
Each drop of rain as big as she  
Imagine what you would do  
If raindrops fell as big as you  

### Finger Plays

+ Involves fingers
+ Recite verbally or can be sung
  + Incy Wincy Spider is an example of a finger play that can be sung
+ Simplest one might be 'two little dickie birds sitting on a wall'

#### **Example of a finger play**

[interlace fingers and bunch up into a ball]
This is the beehive  
Where are the bees?  
Hiding away where nobody sees.  
Creeping they come out of the hive,  
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5! (lifting one finger at a time)

**And a better lyric version of the finger song**:  

Toby thumb, Toby thumb, where are you? Here I am, here I am, how do you do?
Peter Pointer  
Timothy Tall  
Ruby Ring  
Baby Small   
All the fingers

### Songs

+ Just playing and singing songs
+ There are also quite a few songs that are international
  and it's lovely for the children to see that the same songs exist in multiple language
  + `Twinkle twinkle` and `Frere Jacques` are good examples of this
+ Some children will tell you "It's not like that!"
  and this can also be to do with their sensitive period for order
+ When children know songs _really_ well, it's great to try ***rounds*** with them
  + Good examples are `Row row row your boat` and `Frere Jacques`

### Action Songs

+ We move a bit more than just the fingers, but _staying in one place_, not moving around
+ Best example is `Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes` 
  + `If you're happy and you know it`
  + `The Wheels on the Bus`

### Singing Games

+ Requires more movement from the whole group
+ Require cooperation within the group

## Stories
+ Similar to songs and rhymes, one of the ways in which we communicate
+ Stories can also be passed down from one generation to another
  and this is also how culture is transmitted
+ Some cultures have an extremely rich _spoken_ story tradition and some have a rich _written_ story tradition
  + We need to offer children both
+ Good stories:
  + Should stimulate the child's _imagination_ and _love of their mother tongue_
  + Transmit emotions, ideas and feelings
  + Expands child's interest in language because they can see that ideas can be expressed in different ways
  + Enrich and expand the child's vocabulary

### Books

+ Can either be fact or fiction, children do need _both_
+ Need to offer stories that help the children understand reality
+ Offer stories that are meaningful to them and something they can _relate_ to
+ When they are 6 and onwards, they have adapted to reality
  and can distinguish what is real and what is not,
  we can widen the scope of what we offer to children
+ Stay away from animals in stories dressed in clothes for example
  + We can offer children stories about the animals
    where the story/_experience_ is human (_so the children can relate to it_)
    but the animals behave as they would in real life - i.e. owls live in trees,
    not in a city dressed in clothes
  + Some Montessori Guides against `The Very Hungry Caterpillar`
    because children don't eat strawberries or cake etc,
    but Elina is not, you can always have a conversation with the child
    about what caterpillars eat in real life
+ Soothing and helping the child to feel secure,
  so also don't offer scary or violent books,
  or ones with which portray some people as 'bad' which are inherently not:
  + `Snow White`and `Cinderella` portraying step-mothers as bad
  + `3 Little Pigs` portraying the _wolf_ as bad when he's actually just acting like a wolf
+ Don't be swayed by awards, like `Angry Arthur` won lots of awards but is terrible,
  no adults try to help and support the child, unrealistic consequences for his anger,
  creates fearfulness around the consequences of their actions,
  there is zero resolution for their anger, etc. It's awful!
+ When reading a book, always _introduce the title and the author_,
  a child might also want to know more from that author for example
+ A great book example: Ruth Brown's `The Ten Seeds`

#### **3-4 year olds**

+ Great to offer books that consolidate what they know
+ Begin to like stories about relationships, friendships, transport
+ Can begin to get a little more complex

#### **4-5 year olds**

+ More books about other children, from different parts of the world and belief systems
+ Children's humour

#### **5-6 year olds**

+ Can no longer be picture books and be more like chapter books
+ Often have one main character

### In the Children's House

+ Typically always have a children's reading corner
+ Comfortable chairs or sofas or cushions on the floor
+ Display the books facing forward for this age group

> **Note**: not everyone has access to books and that in some countries,
> books aren't even part of the culture.
> In rural areas in some places however, there are library donkeys
> (that bring books to children regularly, like a mobile library),
> camels or library boats for example, super cool.


## 3 Period lesson

Overarching points:
1. Items we choose need to be **contrasting in *name* and *appearance***, e.g. perhaps put in apple, orange and banana but not a lemon and an orange because they can be very similar in appearance
2. There is usually a relationship between these things
3. This is _not a speech lesson_, the child is to pronounce and say the word as they do normally. So if you say `banana` and the child says `nana`, don’t correct them **(letter substitution often happens until age 5; `lellow` instead of `yellow`
4. Very important the 3 period lesson is a positive experience
5. The child should know the object in the child’s First Language first _always_, before going into another language (in the case of a bilingual situation) (child is in adaptation stage, they **must** know it in their Mother/Primary/First tongue first)
6. This is to teach the child new vocabulary
7. 3 at a time, _all_ new vocabulary 

### 1. Naming Stage
+ Can repeat the first stage a couple of times
+ Good to isolate the object and place it infront of the child
+ Encourage them to say the name, repeat after you


### 2. Connecting object with the name 
+ When you invite the child to move one of the objects, _always_ invite the child to put it _back_ into the group before moving to the next one
  + This way the child always has a full group of objects to choose from
+ Do not look at the object you want or touch or point to it, don’t give the child any clues unless you need to!
+ Don’t make silly requests like ‘now put the apple on your head’ because it _distracts the child_
  + The **Focus needs to be on the concept we are trying to impart**, the names of the objects
+ `Pick up`, `show me`, `give me`, `where is`, `please put it here`, `point to`
  + If you only use `where is`, it’s going to be super boring for the child
+ Don’t introduce random new vocabulary - remember you’re not teaching ‘right’ and ‘left’ or positioning vocabulary, you’re **focusing** on the objects
+ Say `thank you` (and variations of) when the 


### 3. Child gives back the name
+ Doesn’t need to be a long stage
+ Important that it doesn’t feel like an inquisition
+ `Now, let’s have a look what we have here, what am I holding? What is this one? [point] And this one?`


## News Period

**Aim**: Help the child to express themselves and articulate their thoughts clearly.
Works other things too but this is the main aim

+ Typically offered to a small group of children, ideally 4-6 children
+ No props, pictures, toys or anything at all (_ever_, there are other activities like show & tell where they do use these props), this is _just_ about sharing news verbally
+ Do these every day, sometimes more than once a day
  + This way children know they will have opportunities to share and you can keep the group small
+ From 5 - 10 minutes
+ Stand up infront of the children
+ Share your news and then invite the children to share their news
+ Encourage them to come and stand next to you infront of the group to share their news (they can also stand where they are but nice to have them practice standing infront of the group)
+ Sometimes child will come and stand infront of the group but nothing comes out
  + ONLY in this situation, you might ask a question or two to get them started
+ Sometimes the child will go on and on and not know when to stop
  + Try to encourage them to stick to one piece of news, “Thank you very much, you know what, we’ll have another opportunity to share news on another day and you can share the rest of your news then!”
+ Always acknowledge: `“Thank you very much for sharing your news”
  + You can always make a short comment and if they share sad news you can show compassion “I’m so sorry to hear your dog passed away, that can be very hard, thank you for sharing that with us”
+ If a child is a little quiet, even if another child says they can’t hear, you **don’t repeat what the child has said**, let the child repeat themselves if they want
  + Just stay quiet throughout, don’t ask them to speak louder
  + It’s a process, you don’t say anything
  + Even if the child whispers and it’s not audible, you say ‘thank you for sharing your news’
  + It’s important that the child is given the feeling that you are listening, they are being heard and thanked for their contribution
