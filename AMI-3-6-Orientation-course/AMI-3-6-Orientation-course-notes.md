# Development of Movement

On Sensory Perception:  
“The child is an observer who through his senses is actively absorbing images, and this is very different from saying that he is able to receive them like a mirror” (Secret of Childhood, p60) implies that the child needs activity. No one can develop without experience, they need opportunity to be active and experience things, ***they are sensory-motor explorers***.

+ Child is not born with coordinated movement, it is acquired over time (unlike with animals where they are born pretty much able to move/walk)
+ Needs other human beings to learn from
+ We all move, we all walk, we all use our hands but no two human beings move in exactly the same way - it’s not _possible_

### Key Milestones 0-3 in Movement
That the child goes through in the _period of 0-3_ in acquiring upright posture
+ Sitting (around 6 m)
+ Crawling (around 8m)
+ Standing (around 10m)
+ Walking (around 12m)
  


## Coordinated Movement
+ **Sensitive Period** for movement, 1.5 years - 4 years

+ Achieving the unity between the mind and the body needed for coordinated movement is a process
+ Depends on the maturation of the nervous system
+ It is only through their only _self propelled_ movement that babies develop coordinated movement
+ Don’t use containers, use low mirrors and objects to encourage movement, use light weight clothing


### In the children's house:  
+ Think about all the movements involved in showing a child how to pour water from a jug for the first time
+ The more we show something with precision, the clearer it is for the child, they have a human tendency to exactness
  + We don’t want to mute ourselves fully, but we need to show with actions and not with words (think about learning to pour water from a jug)
  + Remember they can’t focus on what you’re saying AND what you’re demonstrating at the same time
+ Imitation (human tendency) gives us an idea of HOW to do something but is not blind parroting
+ In a Montessori environment, teaching is not telling/speaking
  + _Everything_ involves ***movement***


# Development of Language
+ Through the human tendency of Communication and the **Absorbent Mind**, a child learns the language of their environment easily, effortlessly and by virtue of their experiences
+ There is no need for something like baby talk because the AM doesn't know easy vs difficult language, so there is no need to downgrade our language for the child
+ There is also the **Sensitive Period** for language (from birth to 6 years), drawing the child's attention/focus to the voice and this human characteristic of language
+ Remember that long before the child can speak, they are taking in everything in 
+ At around **2 months** the child has gained control of the neck and _begins to turn towards the human voice_ which MM called 'delicious music' to the child
+ Around **4 months** they begin to look at the speaker's mouth intently and try to imitate the movements
+ Around **6 months** they begin to babble
+ Telegraphic speech (2 words together are next)
  + Fusive speech where they combine syllable of 2 words "mupper" instead of saying "me, supper"
See 0-3 course notes for a bit more detail on this but **



## Sound Game

**Aim:** is for the child to become _aware_ of the sounds in their language and help them to **analyse the sounds in the words**.

+ This is a SOUND game, not a letter game, so phonograms like `sh` and `ch` and the `dj` sound in `giraffe` are all part of this game 
+ Start playing it immediately as the children come into the Children's House, so from 2.5 onwards.
+ The adult's skill is to organise the groups of kids in such a way that the skill level is the same so that a child who is far ahead doesn't get bored
  + You might say "This one is for Meghan, ..." if you have a child of a different level in the group to keep them interested
+ Indirect preparation for the sandpaper letters and the movable alphabet
+ Many other things grow from this sound game, such as expansion of the child's vocabulary

### Stage 1: Exploring the first sound
#### Stage 1A
+ 6 to 7 objects
+ Hold up an object
+ "I spy with my little eye, something _that I am holding_ that begins with 'b'" (use phonetic sound)
+ Children answer collectively

#### Stage 1B
+ Now 6/7 objects _on a mat_
+ I spy with my little eye, something _on the mat_ beginning with 'l'" (again, phonetic sound)
+ Could just use 2 objects and go up from there if the child needs this
+ You should _start_ with **contrasting sounds**
+ The _progression_ here is to use similar sounds like `b` and `v` or `p`, `m` and `n` for example

#### Stage 1C
+ Choose an area of the environment and be sure that there are _multiple_ things in that area that begin with the same sound
+ I spy with my little eye, something beginning with `b`
  + `bottle`
  + "Yes, can you see anything else?"
  + `basket`, etc
+ The point of this progression is that children understand that there are many things around us that begins with the same sound

### Stage 2: Exploring the first _and_ last sound

#### Stage 2A
+ Still on the mat, start with one pair of items, both with the same beginning sound
+ "I spy with my little eye something that begins with `b` and ends with `a`"
  + `Banana`
+ The idea here is to have multiple pairs of objects with the **same beginning sound** but ***different end sound**
  + Always use _pairs_
+ Examples: `peg` and `plate`, `brush` and `bowl`, `flag` and `fork`, `book` and `bowl`
+ Start with 1 pair and then judging by the child's comfort levels, start to add more pairs

#### Stage 2B
+ Expand into the whole environment, not just pairs
+ Still say the beginning and end sound
+ Also fun out and about, at shops, markets, etc

### Stage 3: Listening to all the sounds in a chosen word (no objects necessary)
+ No objects necessary, just choose a word, like `apple`
+ Typically we use nouns to keep with the pattern from the first stages
+ "What sounds do we hear in `apple`? What's the first sound?" "What's next?" etc
+ Be _very careful_, you're using the **sounds**, `l` not `luh`
  + It has _nothing to do with the spelling_
+ `table` has `t`, **`ai`** (not `a` or `ay`, check the phonetic sheet for the spelling of the sound but you don't actually ever need to spell it), `b`, `l`  
+ `orange` would be `o`, `r`, `i`, `n`,`j`

### Stage 4:
+ Don't give a word but a sound and invite the children to come up with words 
+ "Please think of a word that have `o` in it? You know what? The sound can be at the beginning, anywhere in the middle or even at the end!"

## Classified Cards

**Aim:** Enriching the child's **vocabulary** and helps the child to **classify their environment**.
  

10-15 cards in a set, given to _individual_ children, not a group like the sound game was.
  
Note that these sets need to reflect the child's environment. A kitchen will look different in different in different countries.

1. Introduce the material to the child 
2. Invite the child to spread a floor mat
3. Invite the child to carry the material to the floor mat
4. "Today we chose to work with the kitchen cards (see below for the progression of the card subjects)"
5. Take the picture of the whole (in this case the whole kitchen) "Let's look at this picture here, what do you recognise?" "A clock, ah, do you have a clock on your kitchen wall?" "What else do you see?"
6. Place the piture of the whole in the top centre
7. Start taking cards from the pile and placing them in a line below the picture of the kitchen (on the next row), one by one and **asking them what each item is**
    + If the child knows the name, leave the card on the mat
    + If the child _doesn't_ know the name, name the image and either make a mental note or **turn the card over and put it in a separate pile**
    + Occasionally add in some commentary about the items "yes, it's a pan, we could even call it a frying pan", "Yes, do you have one of these at home?"
8. When you're done, invite the child to put most of the cards away and **leave 3 cards out** and then you would give a _3 period lesson_ (see below)
    + 3 cards
    + Contrasting in appearance and name

You would include this progression of the cards:
+ Start with the `home` environment, things like kitchen, bedroom, etc
+ Move to `neighbourhood` environment, things like train station, market, florist, park (specific to each child of course)
+ Move to `cultural` area, including geography, botany, arts, science and music

## Songs and Poetry
+ Ways through which we can continue to expand and enrich the child's vocabulary
+ Very important part of our interaction with children and one of the ways we communicate
+ Can be a very nice bonding moment between children and also children and adults in the Children's House
+ Songs that are already familiar to the child can be a very good bridge between their home life and the Children's House
+ Should be interwoven into the daily life at the children's house
  + Should have songs and poems for every ocassion and just for fun!
+ May also help children who are shy to come out of their shell a little
+ Have to be careful we choose something appropriate for the children and their culture
+ _Avoid anything that is violent_ or disrespectful
  + `3 Blind Mice` is a good example of this, terrible lyrics!
  + `Atirei o Pau ao Gato` in Portuguese!
  + Animals eating other animals for example, like the monkeys SNAP being eaten by an alligator

**5 categories of Poetry to discuss today:**
1. Poems and Rhymes
2. Finger Plays
3. Songs
4. Action Songs 
5. Singing Games

### Poems & Rhymes
+ A _poem_ is often a little more complex or subtle in meaning than a _rhyme_
  + Poems may also have a slightly more complicated structure
+ Nursery rhymes are an example of rhymes

#### **Example of a poem**

The Ladybird,  
by Spike Milligan

How brave a ladybird must be  
Each drop of rain as big as she  
Imagine what you would do  
If raindrops fell as big as you  

### Finger Plays
+ Involves fingers
+ Recite verbally or can be sung
  + Incy Wincy Spider is an example of a finger play that can be sung
+ Simplest one might be 'two little dickie birds sitting on a wall'

#### **Example of a finger play**
[interlace fingers and bunch up into a ball]
This is the beehive  
Where are the bees?  
Hiding away where nobody sees.  
Creeping they come out of the hive,  
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5! (lifting one finger at a time)

**And a better lyric version of the finger song**:  
Toby thumb, Toby thumb, where are you? Here I am, here I am, how do you do?
Peter Pointer  
Timothy Tall  
Ruby Ring  
Baby Small   
All the fingers

### Songs
+ Just playing and singing songs
+ There are also quite a few songs that are international and it's lovely for the children to see that the same songs exist in multiple language
  + `Twinkle twinkle` and `Frere Jacques` are good examples of this
+ Some children will tell you "It's not like that!" and this can also be to do with their sensitive period for order
+ When children know songs _really_ well, it's great to try ***rounds*** with them
  + Good examples are `Row row row your boat` and `Frere Jacques`

### Action Songs
+ We move a bit more than just the fingers, but _staying in one place_, not moving around
+ Best example is `Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes` 
  + `If you're happy and you know it`
  + `The Wheels on the Bus`

### Singing Games
+ Requires more movement from the whole group
+ Require cooperation within the group

## Stories
+ Similar to songs and rhymes, one of the ways in which we communicate
+ Stories can also be passed down from one generation to another and this is also how culture is transmitted
+ Some cultures have an extremely rich _spoken_ story tradition and some have a rich _written_ story tradition
  + We need to offer children both
+ Good stories:
  + Should stimulate the child's _imagination_ and _love of their mother tongue_
  + Transmit emotions, ideas and feelings
  + Expands child's interest in language because they can see that ideas can be expressed in different ways
  + Enrich and expand the child's vocabulary

### Books

+ Can either be fact or fiction, children do need _both_
+ Need to offer stories that help the children understand reality
+ Offer stories that are meaningful to them and something they can _relate_ to
+ When they are 6 and onwards, they have adapted to reality and can distinguish what is real and what is not, we can widen the scope of what we offer to children
+ Stay away from animals in stories dressed in clothes for example
  + We can offer children stories about the animals where the story/_experience_ is human (_so the children can relate to it_) but the animals behave as they would in real life - i.e. owls live in trees, not in a city dressed in clothes
  + Some Montessori Guides against `The Very Hungry Caterpillar` because children don't eat strawberries or cake etc, but Elina is not, you can always have a conversation with the child about what caterpillars eat in real life
+ Soothing and helping the child to feel secure, so also don't offer scary or violent books, or ones with which portray some people as 'bad' which are inherently not:
  + `Snow White`and `Cinderella` portraying step-mothers as bad
  + `3 Little Pigs` portraying the _wolf_ as bad when he's actually just acting like a wolf
+ Don't be swayed by awards, like `Angry Arthur` won lots of awards but is terrible, no adults try to help and support the child, unrealistic consequences for his anger, creates fearfulness around the consequences of their actions, there is zero resolution for their anger, etc. It's awful!
+ When reading a book, always _introduce the title and the author_, a child might also want to know more from that author for example
+ A great book example: Ruth Brown's `The Ten Seeds`

#### **3-4 year olds**
+ Great to offer books that consolidate what they know
+ Begin to like stories about relationships, friendships, transport
+ Can begin to get a little more complex

#### **4-5 year olds**
+ More books about other children, from different parts of the world and belief systems
+ Children's humour

#### **5-6 year olds**
+ Can no longer be picture books and be more like chapter books
+ Often have one main character

### In the Children's House
+ Typically always have a children's reading corner
+ Comfortable chairs or sofas or cushions on the floor
+ Display the books facing forward for this age group

Note that not everyone has access to books and that in some countries, books aren't even part of the culture. In rural areas in some places however, there are library donkeys (that bring books to children regularly, like a mobile library), camels or library boats for example, super cool.
